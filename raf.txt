I've spent my childhood in the midst of greenery,in
a remote village.My father is a day labourer and my mother is a housewife.
I am frank and pretty friendly. Some say I'm introvert but when it comes to
public speaking,I sure talk! I have my only weakness which is , I can't say
No to people.I find it difficult to refuse people specially when it's about helping them.
